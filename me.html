            <h2><strong>About Me</p></strong></h2>
            <p> My name is <strong>Anastassiya Savostina</strong>. I am from Kazakhstan.
                In February 2020 me and my family moved to the United
                States. <i></i> I recieved a
                Bachelor's degree from <i>Almaty Technological University, Kazakhstan</i> where I
                studied Education with a focus on Accounting and Finance. In my country I have been working
                as an accountant for a long time.
                Here, in USA, I decided to change my major and I working in QA for the last year. Making sure
                that all works, looks and feels good. Mainly focusing on functional and UI testing.
                As a part of the QA team I am performing black-box testing on different platforms
                like Windows and Mac. I am working with TestRail ahd Jira.I do my best to make sure
                our customers get a quality product which meets their needs.
